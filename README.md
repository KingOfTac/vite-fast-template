# vite-fast-template
Vite + FAST + Yarn3 starter template

This Template is meant as a starter for creating libraries or applications built on [FAST](https://fast.design)

## Getting Started
This template uses Yarn v2 [zero installs](https://yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs), so no need to run an install script after cloning. Just start the dev server or start building your own FAST-based libraries.

## Scripts
Start the included Vite starter app
```shell
yarn start:dev
```
